# 📩 Email Header Auto-Triage using LLM

## 🔍 Summary

This use case focuses on the automated triage of suspicious email headers using Large Language Models (LLMs). Email-based threats like phishing, business email compromise (BEC), and social engineering remain one of the **top attack vectors**. Automating header analysis saves SOC analysts time, reduces alert fatigue, and accelerates incident response.
